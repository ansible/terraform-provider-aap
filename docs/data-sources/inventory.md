## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aap = {

    }
  }
}

  host     = "https://AAP_HOST"

data "aap_inventory" "sample_by_id" {
  id = 1
}

output "inventory_details_with_id" {
  value = data.aap_inventory.sample_by_id
}

data "aap_inventory" "sample_with_name_and_org_name" {
  name              = "Demo Inventory"
  organization_name = "Default"
}

output "inventory_details_with_name_and_org_name" {
  value = data.aap_inventory.sample_with_name_and_org_name
}
```
